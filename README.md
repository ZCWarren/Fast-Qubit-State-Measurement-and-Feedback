# Fast-Qubit-State-Measurement-and-Feedback
Objective:

  Ion trap based quantum computing system relies on fast detection of the qubit state. The primary
objective is to develop a scalable and robust qubit state detection hardware and software for trapped
ions.
  As the number of qubits becomes larger, the detection time becomes a concern. In this project,
different approaches to detect the qubit state will be explored. The scheme that will be implemented
should have the ability to parallelly readout the qubits, analyse the state and feedback to the control
system
